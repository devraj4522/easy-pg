## Inspiration
India is developing and so are the opportunities. Anyone living outside their home needs better accommodation and healthy food. The central theme is to Find suitable accommodation while you are away from home. Many of our friends are staying away from the family and home to have an excellent paying guest home with affordable pricing and a good living environment.

## What it does
We are building a web platform to find affordable accommodation, with proper verification of their services. So that students or professionals feel safe as well as find a home at the best rate/deals.

##  How We built it
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Javascript, google map and Material UI.
Backend: Node.js, MongoDB, rest-api, express, JWT etc.
Github: We have used Github Actions for Continous Integration

## Challenges I ran into
It was a critical task to get a good accuracy for our system model but at last, we are able to achieve accuracy on our test dataset.
Creating the database
Many bugs during making the application

## Accomplishments that We're proud of
We were successfully able to implement all the features that we have thought of before the hackathon.


## What's next for Easy-PG
Creating a proper review system with user-generated data.
Listing them in various categories according to prices and services.
Cover all PGs in the country.
